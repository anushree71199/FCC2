1. Palindrome-checker: 
   Our goal for solving this problem is tidying up the string passed in, and checking whether it is in fact a     
   palindrome. If you are unsure of what a palindrome is, it is a word or phrase that when reversed spells the same thing forwards or backwards. A simple example is mom, when you reverse the letters, it spells the same thing! Another example of a palindrome is race car. When we take out anything that is not a character it becomes racecar which is the same spelled forwards or backwards! 
   Once we have determined whether it is a palindrome or not we want to return either true or false based on our findings.
2. Roman-numeral-converter:
   Convert the given number into a roman numeral. Creating two arrays, one with the Roman Numerals and one with the decimal equivalent for the new forms will be very helpful.
3. Caesars-cipher: 
   One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount. Use String.charCodeAt() to convert the English character to ASCII.
4. Telephone-number-validator:
   The task is not that hard to understand, implementing it is the hardest part. You have a to validate a US phone number. This means there is a certain amount of numbers required, while you donâ€™t need to put the country code, you will still need the area code and use one of the few formats allowed. 
5. Cash-register: 
   You have to create a program that will return an object containing a status key and a change key. The value of status is the string INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS, CLOSED, or OPEN, and the value of change is a 2D array of the change due.
